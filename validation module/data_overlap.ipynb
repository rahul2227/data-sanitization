    "\n",
    "This notebook validates the effectiveness of our data sanitization pipeline by analyzing the overlap between the WikiText‑103 training data and the reference PG‑19 dataset. The goals of this module are to:\n",
    "- **Reduce Contamination:** Ensure that passages overlapping with PG‑19 (or other disallowed content) are flagged.\n",
    "- **Prevent Memorization:** we are removing these overlaps to reduce the chance that the model memorizes evaluation content.\n",
    "- **Maintain Data Integrity:** We simulate the removal of contaminated data (flagged as such) without actually altering the original dataset.\n",

    "In this notebook, we:\n",
    "1. **Identify Overlaps**\n",
    "2. **Compare Pre‑ vs Post‑Sanitization**\n",
    "3. **Visualize the Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* The “post‑sanitization” stage is simulated by assuming that all flagged segments would be removed.\n",
    "Well this was done to maintain dataset integrity so that it can still be used after analysis"
